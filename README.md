# Third React Project

It is my 3rd React Project in my journey to learn React. It is a dice game where you choose a number and then roll the dice. If the number on the dice is equal to the number chosen by you, you get points equal to the number chosen. If its not equal, you lose 2 points. There's a start window which takes you to the game as well.
